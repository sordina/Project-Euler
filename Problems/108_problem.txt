
In the following equation x, y, and n are positive integers.

1x
 + 
1y
 = 
1n

For n = 4 there are exactly three distinct solutions:

1 5
 + 
1 20
 = 
1 4
1 6
 + 
1 12
 = 
1 4
1 8
 + 
1 8
 = 
1 4

What is the least value of n for which the number of distinct solutions exceeds one-thousand?
NOTE: This problem is an easier version of problem 110; it is strongly advised that you solve this one first.
