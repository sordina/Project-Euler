An irrational decimal fraction is created by concatenating the positive integers:

0.123456789101112131415161718192021...
             -

It can be seen that the 12th digit of the fractional part is 1.

If d[n] represents the nth digit of the fractional part, find the value of the following expression.

d[1] x d[10] x d[100] x d[1000] x d[10000] x d[100000] x d[1000000]
